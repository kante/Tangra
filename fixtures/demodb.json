Candidate, 647-864-1472 <br /> Technologies for Aging Gracefully Lab, University of Toronto, Department of Computer Science&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Faculty Supervisor&nbsp;</strong><br /> Ronald Baecker, Ph.D., Professor, 416-978-6983\u2028&nbsp;<br /> Technologies for Aging Gracefully Lab, University of Toronto, Department of Computer Science&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Project Purpose and Procedures&nbsp;</strong><br /> The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of mental fitness interventions and board games on cognitive performance in older adults. We are also interested in how the online method of delivery affects participant retention, motivation, and whether data collected online can serve to validate mental fitness interventions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To assist in this regard, you are asked to participate in the following online study. It will consist of an initial questionnaire and playing games over 10 45-minute sessions within 30 days. Your cognitive performance will be evaluated using simple online tasks before and after the experiment, as well as 15 days afterwards. Finally, a semi-structured interview will be completed over a video messaging platform to gather your thoughts and feedback on the study and on the online system. We will maintain contact with you over e-mail. No other identifying information will be collected, your name or e-mail will not be associated with your data, and no personally identifying information will be published.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We expect the study to take approximately <strong>15 hours</strong> to complete over the course of <strong>45 days</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Risks&nbsp;</strong><br /> There are no risks believed to be associated with this project as participation is voluntary and no individuals will be identified.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Benefits&nbsp;</strong><br /> Information gathered in this study will contribute to understanding how to evaluate mental fitness interventions and how participants respond to online experimentation. This data can make it easier for researchers to conduct studies to validate mental fitness tasks and provide users with better, more reliable information about the benefits they can expect. Participants may also experience minor improvements in executive function, visuo-spatial reasoning and vocabulary.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Remuneration/Compensation</strong><br /> We are very grateful for your participation. While you will receive no compensation for participating, we will donate 3$ to a registered Canadian charity of your choice for every game-playing session you successfully complete.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Confidentiality&nbsp;</strong><br /> No individuals are identified in this study and identifying personal information will be stored separately from data. Documents and electronic data will be securely kept for five years and then destroyed.&nbsp;Identifying details will be destroyed as soon as the study is complete.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Contact information about the study&nbsp;</strong><br /> If you have questions or desire further information with respect to the study, you may contact Velian Pandeliev at vpandeliev@gmail.com or 647-864-1472.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Contact information about the rights of research subjects&nbsp;</strong><br /> If you have any concerns about your treatment or rights as a research subject, you may contact the Office of Research Ethics at ethics.review@utoronto.ca or 416-946-3273.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I agree to participate in the study as outlined above.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My participation in this study is voluntary and I understand that I may withdraw at any time.</p>", "assess_blocks": 2, "stub": "DEM", "eligibility": "<p>To be eligible you must:</p>\r\n<p>- be 45+</p>\r\n<p>- suffer from no cognitive impairments</p>\r\n<p>- have access to a computer and broadband Internet at home</p>\r\n<p>- have normal or corrected-to-normal vision</p>\r\n<p>- speak English as a first language</p>", "boggle_duration": 30, "task_session_dur": 3, "assess_trials": 10, "instructions": "<p>In this study you will alternate playing two standard board games: Rush Hour and Boggle, or two mental fitness tasks from a Canadian mental fitness vendor.</p>", "start_date": "2011-02-04", "description": "<p>This study compares the effects of playing standard board games to completing mental fitness interventions online.</p>"}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "studies.stage", "fields": {"name": "board game test", "sessions": 100, "url": "/study/choose_game", "study": 1, "stub": "BDG", "deadline": 10, "instructions": "<p>Instructions: This is a test stage for board games</p>", "description": "<p>This is a test stage for board games</p>"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "studies.stage", "fields": {"name": "mental fitness test", "sessions": 100, "url": "/study/choose_task", "study": 1, "stub": "MTF", "deadline": 10, "instructions": "<p>This is a testing stage for mental fitness tasks</p>", "description": "<p>This is a testing stage for mental fitness tasks</p>"}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "studies.stage", "fields": {"name": "Informed Consent", "sessions": 1, "url": "/study/ic", "study": 2, "stub": "INC", "deadline": 10, "instructions": "<p>Before we begin the study, you are to read the Informed Consent form.
