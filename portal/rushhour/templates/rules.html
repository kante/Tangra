		<h2>How to play:</h2>
		<p> The Rush Hour board consists of a 6x6 grid, which is populated with cars. Your car is the red one, and it's stuck in traffic.
			Your goal is to clear the way for your red car out of the playing grid and into the target space to escape to freedom.
			To do so, hold the mouse button while over a car and drag the mouse to shift the car out of your way.
			Cars can only go forwards and backwards with respect to the way they're facing.
