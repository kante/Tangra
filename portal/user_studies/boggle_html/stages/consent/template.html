    <b>Project Purpose and Procedures</b><br>
    The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of mental fitness interventions 
    and board games on cognitive performance in older adults. We are also interested in how 
    the online method of delivery affects participant retention, motivation, and whether data 
    collected online can serve to validate mental fitness interventions.
    <p>

    <p>
    To assist in this regard, you are asked to participate in the following online study. 
    It will consist of an initial questionnaire and playing games over 12 1-minute sessions 
    within 30 days. Your cognitive performance will be evaluated using simple online tasks 
    before and after the experiment. We will maintain contact with you over e-mail. 
    No other identifying information will be collected, your name or e-mail will 
    not be associated with your data, and no personally identifying information 
    will be published. 
    <p>


    <p>
        <b>Potential Risks </b><br>
    
    There are no risks believed to be associated with this project as participation 
    is voluntary and no individuals will be identified.
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Potential Benefits </b><br>
    Information gathered in this study will contribute to understanding how to evaluate 
    mental fitness interventions and how participants respond to online experimentation. 
    This data can make it easier for researchers to conduct studies to validate mental 
    fitness tasks and provide users with better, more reliable information about the 
    benefits they can expect. Participants may also experience minor improvements in 
    executive function, visuo-spatial reasoning and vocabulary.
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Remuneration/Compensation</b><br>
    We are very grateful for your participation. While you will receive no compensation for participating, we will donate 3$ to a registered Canadian charity of your choice for every game-playing session you successfully complete.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Confidentiality </b><br>
    No individuals are identified in this study and identifying personal information will be stored separately from data. Documents and electronic data will be securely kept for five years and then destroyed. Identifying details will be destroyed as soon as the study is complete.
