					<p>
						Injuries represent a significant portion of mortality and disability worldwide.  Of note, injury is the leading cause of death among Canadian youth.  In addition to a large negative impact on health, both intentional and non-intentional injuries have a widespread effect on a community.  These effects include economic costs, such as medical and care expenses and loss of productivity, and a large social burden from the loss of young lives and family members. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Rural communities experience a mortality rate from injury that is 3.5 times greater than the general Canadian population.  Certain patterns of injury can be related to demographics as children and adolescents and elderly persons are frequently over-represented in rural areas.  Still, both groups are more likely to be injured than their urban counterparts.  There are many factors in this disparity.  Road conditions and difficulty maintaining clear roadways, slow-moving industrial machinery in traffic, and lower rates of seatbelt use could explain the higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents.  Older construction and difficulty heating homes may lead to more residential fires.  A greater proportion of community members involved in occupational hazards contribute to industrial and agricultural accidents.  Also, the length of discovery and transport from site of injury can lead to delays receiving specialized emergency care.
