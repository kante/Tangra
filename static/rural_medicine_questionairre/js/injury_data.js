	"Car traffic often outpaces farm traffic.  When large industrial or farm vehicles and regular cars share the road, this can be hazardous – especially if visibility between drivers is poor.",
	"Some communities are home to groups that rely on horse-drawn vehicles, like carts and wagons for transportation.  Similar in size to industrial and farm vehicles, buggies can also be dangerous on public roads because of their speed and lack of seatbelts.",
	"ATVs are a very popular choice for transportation, recreation, and work.  However, these vehicles can be dangerous when used by drivers who are inexperienced or physically lack the strength to operate them safely (children, for example).  ATVs are involved in almost three thousand hospitalizations and 70 deaths per year across Canada.",
	"Walking and cycling along high-speed roads is extremely dangerous.  To illustrate, 44% of fatal car-bicycle collisions are on roadways with a speed limit higher than 80km/hr.  However, in smaller or remote communities, bike and foot traffic along highways may be unavoidable to travel in between homes and communities.",

	"Approximately 2/3 of collisions causing fatalities and 1/3 of collisions causing serious injury occur on rural roads, which are typically two undivided lanes where speed is a significant factor.",
	
	"Collisions involving drivers and passengers who do not wear seatbelts typically result more commonly in severe injury and fatality than when seatbelts are worn.  Seatbelt use is increasing in rural areas, but is still below the national average in the most remote areas and among drivers of heavy duty vehicles which are more often used by rural drivers."
