		<h2>How to play:</h2>
		<p> The Rush Hour board consists of a 6x6 square grid which is populated with cars (represented by rounded rectangles on the board). </p><p>Your car is the red one, and it's stuck in traffic.
			Your goal is to clear the way for your red car to the target space to the right of the grid (denoted with a dashed line) to escape to freedom.
			</p><p>To do so, you will have to move the other cars out of its way. Hold the mouse button while on a car and drag the mouse to move it.
			Cars can only go forwards and backwards with respect to the way they're facing.<br/><br/>
			</p>
